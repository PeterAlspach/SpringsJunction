## Wangapeka (December 1986)
### Peter Van Essen and me

__05 December__:  
Left Rolling River carpark around 10:00 in fine weather.  Initial vegetation scrubby - probably reverted after early attempts at farming.  Passed Stoney Creek, then a little while further Kiwi Stream.  Previous to this (after about 1$\frac{1}{2}$ hours) Peter had aggravated a small toe blister gained the week before on Mt Arthur.  Lunched at 12:00 just before Kings Hut.  Put on extra pair of socks as my feet were not feeling the best.  At Kings Hut discovered a lemon and fishing line.  Peter mentioned that the Karamea was reputed to offer some of the best trout fishing in NZ so we felt the line would be better left in the Roaring Lion Hut!  The lemon would not keep so we ate it.  Old Kings Hut was full of character.  Built by a prospector around 1932 and used throughout the Depression.  Later, Mr King lived in Wellington (Lower Hutt) but spent summers prospecting his claim.  He did around 1980 and his ashes were scatter around the hut and claim, thereby making the place somewhat mystical.  A photo of the old man in the hut showed an intriguing physiognomy.

After lunch ($\frac{3}{4}$ hour) our speed slackened to a little under stated track times.  The packs were weighing us down.  The pain^[For this trip I was using my original Nelson Trapper frame-pack, until a retrofitted wasteband]!  Initially, I had had twinges in my lower back but fortunately these ceased.  However, my feet were sore (although not blistered) and my left knee and thigh gave some pain.  Fatigue was quite intense by reaching Stoney Hut (6$\frac{1}{2}$ hours walking - 16:45).  So much so that a stumble would have been hard to recover from.  Not that I did stmble.  I used Arnica on my knee at Stoney Hut but not elsewhere (on me that is!).  Stiffened up baly however.

Interesting botany lessons from Peter, who was also feeling the strain of the pack weight.  Lessons on alternation of the generations helped to relieve, or rather distract from the pain!  It was really quite bad but now, and even at the time, a certain ehtereal power seemed to make it all not merely tolerable but rewarding.

Excellend view of Patriarch from just after Kiwi Stream.  Very hot out of the bush, but alas the sun had disappeared behind clouds by the time we reached this hut.  Thus the socks and singlet I rinsed will not dry.  Excellent dinner.

Must brush teeth and tidy up before it gets too dark ...

__06 December__:  
Having crossed Wangpeka Saddle, I have decided to make notes as we go along.  There is so much to write.  Coprosmas have opposite leaves with a stipule between them.  _Griselinia_'s distinguishing feature is its uneven leaf (i.e., where the leaf edge meets the stem is not the same on both sides).  A great view of Nugget Knob from the Saddle, but not one I thought would photograph well.  The damage done by the Murchison Earthquake (1928?^[Actually, it was 1929]) has been apparent all day.  Much more impressive than the views from the Buller road.

Currently we are pawing oveer a mossy flat looking at insects and tiny flowers through a hand lens, and Peter is photographing.

As yet, although a little stiff, no acute discomfort.  The pack is still heavy, but comfortably so - if that's possible!

Now at Trevor Carter Hut.  Named in memory of an 18 year old hunter who died in 1972 when the hut was built.  Quite what other connection there may be is not stated.  Sandfly Hut could be a more appropriate name.

This hut is built at the base of the Luna Slips (which I photographed earlier with Mt Luna in the distance.  Also tried to get a photo which captured some of the natural rockery beauty of the _Heliochrysum_ spp.  Unfortunately, this latter and the first view of Kendal were on the end of the old film which I think may not have wound on properly).  Anhow, the hut is built on slip territory and the Karamea River nearby has been partially dammed thus slowing its course and making for some nice swimming holes.  Peter was game, but not I - sandflies too bad!

Arnica on left knee and shoulders.  Everything else OK today.

Saw a couple of paradise ducks at Stone Hut.  And a solitary blue duck, whose call pulled me out of bed last night.  Heard another blue as we neared this hut.

The flowers have been magnificent so far.  Not only the _Heliochrysum_ spp, but many others.  Native iris, and a tiny wee snap-dragon.  Some shrub in the Erica family.  A ranunculid.  Others whose names Peter has told me but which escape me now.

He remarked upon  _Neopanax_ which was trifoliate, with juvenile stage highly digitated.  Also a beautiful green - almost translucent.  I have rarely (maybe never) tramped so slowly as today (almost double track times), but the botanising has made it so enjoyable!

__07 December__  
Lunch - After dinner yesterday we wantdered up the slip site behind the hut to look at the colonising plants.  Great walking without a pack!  The main colonising shrub was _Gaultheria_ (the Ericaceae).  Beautifully shaped leaves with red edging in younger group, and covered in creamy bell-like flowers.  Generally only 500mm or so high, but some reaching over a metre.  Obviouly capable of growing under poor conditions.  Also present was a prostrate type, and beech seedlings.  Numerour mosses, sedges etc.

This morning we left around 08:00.  There was considerable low cloud on the tops but as expected this cleared around 09:30.  Saw the biggest trout either of us had ever seen.  In the Karamea, just before turning up into the trackless country up Kendall Creek.  Going has been very varied - strolling through open beech forest, struggling through slip damage, bashing through scrubby Coprosomas, rock-hopping by creeks.  Currently heading for a bivvy on the bushline tonight.

Attractive columbular _Rubus_ flowering here - grabbed a photograph.

18:00 - Ridge leading to Kendall Ridge around 5000'^[This was the days of inch to mile maps].  It has been hard yakka up to here and Peter had seen snow earlier so felt it unnecessary to carry water.  Unfortunately, we are still at least 2 hours from the snow.  I am very tired, thirsty and miserable.  I don't think I can make it to the snow as the ridge between looks very fierce.  I know Peter wants to carry on, and thus feel very much of a wet blanket holding him back.  I finally agreed to give it a go, but by then he decided it would be wrong to push me (not that he has).  Hence he has gone for a brief recee to look for water.  I hope this split is the right decision.  In a snese its OK.  Peter was going to come by himself so going alone looking for water is not too different.  I am, of course, sitting comfortably by the packs.  In a way I hope he finds water.  I am so thirsty now that the sight of Peter returning with two bottles of water would surely gladden my heart!  But then if he doesn't find any it's back the way we came.  This prospect doesn't bring me great joy, but currently is more desirable than going on.  The returning option is unattractive for two reasons: i) it is defeatist and ii) it is very steep and I am not looking forward to going down a slope that was so difficult to come up.

I must remember in future not to set my sights too high with regard to tramping.  There are many magnificent walks to do without pushing myself to the limits.  Here comes Peter now - no water.  So back down the way we came.

__08 December__  
09:00 - Bivvied last night by a creek at about 3000'.  Only flattish spot in the flood-water course so we risked it.  No rain.  This morning much like yesterday morning, with he same promise of a fine day.  Peter has gone on another recee.  We keep getting bluffed out.  Not so bad without a pack (as Peter is now while I wait on a ledge).  Unfortunately it is still misty thus making route finding ratehr awkward.  This won't lift until ten-ish.

Last night we didn't finish eating until after 21:30, and the sleep was not exactly comfortalbe.  However, despite the restless sleep I feel better now, but still more daunted than usual.

Coming up passed the waterfall near the bottom yesterday was fascinating.  Solid rock with natural flowforms scupted into them.  Also one very nice spa-sized bath.  Very refreshing to dunk one's head into!

Trying to make the base of that waterfall was difficult.  We tried to bash through 3m scrub first.  Hands and knees territory.  This proved to be unsuccessful, but ... we did stumble (literally) on a group of native orchids.  Beautiful modest green.  We retreated and found an easier way.

Bluffed out - back to yesterday's spot.  But this time carrying water!!

10:30 - Now back on top of ridge that we had reached last night before returning.  Took an hour from the creek.  Mist has lifted and the sun is shining brightly.

Coming up we ventured upon a bluff with a cree slope below.  We skirted along underneath this bluff (south west aspect) following a row of mountain buttercups (_Ranunculus insignus_) looking for all the world like someone had planted them there.  Presumably they were following the moisture seeping out of the bluff.

Also in the same spot were ting flowering _Euphrasia_ (eye bright).  These pretty little flowers - white with a yellow throat and dark filiaments looking insect like - are a root parasite.  Feathery tutu (_Coriaria) are also fairly common and presently in flower.

Weather possibly packing in - better go.

__09 December__  
10:55 - We have stopped along the track to photograph some orchids.  Back to yesterday ... We were unable to make it further up the ridge without undue anxiety.  The rock is still unstable from the earthquakes.  Even huge boulders (500 lbs?) could give way under had or foot.  With the steepness of the country in many places a slip would be fatal.  We didn't come for that sort of thrill!  So it was back down, passed the waterfall and flowforms, down Kendall Creek, and Taraua Tramping Club walk to Thor Hut.  That day our backpacking began a little after eight in the morning and finished a little before eight in the evening.
