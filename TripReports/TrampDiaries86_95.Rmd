## Wangapeka (December 1986)
### Peter Van Essen and me

__05 December__:  
Left Rolling River carpark around 10:00 in fine weather.  Initial vegetation scrubby - probably reverted after early attempts at farming.  Passed Stoney Creek, then a little while further Kiwi Stream.  Previous to this (after about 1$\frac{1}{2}$ hours) Peter had aggravated a small toe blister gained the week before on Mt Arthur.  Lunched at 12:00 just before Kings Hut.  Put on extra pair of socks as my feet were not feeling the best.  At Kings Hut discovered a lemon and fishing line.  Peter mentioned that the Karamea was reputed to offer some of the best trout fishing in NZ so we felt the line would be better left in the Roaring Lion Hut!  The lemon would not keep so we ate it.  Old Kings Hut was full of character.  Built by a prospector around 1932 and used throughout the Depression.  Later, Mr King lived in Wellington (Lower Hutt) but spent summers prospecting his claim.  He died around 1980 and his ashes were scatter around the hut and claim, thereby making the place somewhat mystical.  A photo of the old man in the hut showed an intriguing physiognomy.

After lunch ($\frac{3}{4}$ hour) our speed slackened to a little under stated track times.  The packs were weighing us down.  The pain^[For this trip I was using my original Nelson Trapper frame-pack, with a retrofitted waste-band]!  Initially, I had had twinges in my lower back but fortunately these ceased.  However, my feet were sore (although not blistered) and my left knee and thigh gave some pain.  Fatigue was quite intense by reaching Stone Hut (6$\frac{1}{2}$ hours walking - 16:45).  So much so that a stumble would have been hard to recover from.  Not that I did stumble.  I used Arnica on my knee at Stone Hut but not elsewhere (on me that is!).  Stiffened up badly however.

Interesting botany lessons from Peter, who was also feeling the strain of the pack weight.  Lessons on alternation of the generations helped to relieve, or rather distract from the pain!  It was really quite bad but now, and even at the time, a certain ethereal power seemed to make it all not merely tolerable but rewarding.

Excellent view of Patriarch from just after Kiwi Stream.  Very hot out of the bush, but alas the sun had disappeared behind clouds by the time we reached this hut.  Thus the socks and singlet I rinsed will not dry.  Excellent dinner.

Must brush teeth and tidy up before it gets too dark ...

__06 December__:  
Having crossed Wangpeka Saddle, I have decided to make notes as we go along.  There is so much to write.  Coprosmas have opposite leaves with a stipule between them.  _Griselinia_'s distinguishing feature is its uneven leaf (i.e., where the leaf edge meets the stem is not the same on both sides).  A great view of Nugget Knob from the Saddle, but not one I thought would photograph well.  The damage done by the Murchison Earthquake (1928?^[Actually, it was 1929]) has been apparent all day.  Much more impressive than the views from the Buller road.

Currently we are pawing over a mossy flat looking at insects and tiny flowers through a hand lens, and Peter is photographing.

As yet, although a little stiff, no acute discomfort.  The pack is still heavy, but comfortably so - if that's possible!

Now at Trevor Carter Hut.  Named in memory of an 18 year old hunter who died in 1972 when the hut was built.  Quite what other connection there may be is not stated.  Sandfly Hut could be a more appropriate name.

This hut is built at the base of the Luna Slips (which I photographed earlier with Mt Luna in the distance.  Also tried to get a photo which captured some of the natural rockery beauty of the _Heliochrysum_ spp.  Unfortunately, this latter and the first view of Kendall were on the end of the old film which I think may not have wound on properly).  Anyhow, the hut is built on slip territory and the Karamea River nearby has been partially dammed thus slowing its course and making for some nice swimming holes.  Peter was game, but not I - sandflies too bad!

Arnica on left knee and shoulders.  Everything else OK today.

Saw a couple of paradise ducks at Stone Hut.  And a solitary blue duck, whose call pulled me out of bed last night.  Heard another blue as we neared this hut.

The flowers have been magnificent so far.  Not only the _Heliochrysum_ spp, but many others.  Native iris, and a tiny wee snap-dragon.  Some shrub in the Erica family.  A ranunculid.  Others whose names Peter has told me but which escape me now.

He remarked upon  _Neopanax_ which was trifoliate, with juvenile stage highly digitated.  Also a beautiful green - almost translucent.  I have rarely (maybe never) tramped so slowly as today (almost double track times), but the botanising has made it so enjoyable!

__07 December__  
Lunch - After dinner yesterday we wandered up the slip site behind the hut to look at the colonising plants.  Great walking without a pack!  The main colonising shrub was _Gaultheria_ (the Ericaceae).  Beautifully shaped leaves with red edging in younger group, and covered in creamy bell-like flowers.  Generally only 500mm or so high, but some reaching over a metre.  Obviously capable of growing under poor conditions.  Also present was a prostrate type, and beech seedlings.  Numerous mosses, sedges etc.

This morning we left around 08:00.  There was considerable low cloud on the tops but as expected this cleared around 09:30.  Saw the biggest trout either of us had ever seen.  In the Karamea, just before turning up into the trackless country up Kendall Creek.  Going has been very varied - strolling through open beech forest, struggling through slip damage, bashing through scrubby Coprosomas, rock-hopping by creeks.  Currently heading for a bivvy on the bushline tonight.

Attractive columnar _Rubus_ flowering here - grabbed a photograph.

18:00 - Ridge leading to Kendall Ridge around 5000'^[This was the days of inch to mile maps].  It has been hard yakka up to here and Peter had seen snow earlier so felt it unnecessary to carry water.  Unfortunately, we are still at least 2 hours from the snow.  I am very tired, thirsty and miserable.  I don't think I can make it to the snow as the ridge between looks very fierce.  I know Peter wants to carry on, and thus feel very much of a wet blanket holding him back.  I finally agreed to give it a go, but by then he decided it would be wrong to push me (not that he has).  Hence he has gone for a brief recce to look for water.  I hope this split is the right decision.  In a sense it's OK.  Peter was going to come by himself so going alone looking for water is not too different.  I am, of course, sitting comfortably by the packs.  In a way I hope he finds water.  I am so thirsty now that the sight of Peter returning with two bottles of water would surely gladden my heart!  But then if he doesn't find any it's back the way we came.  This prospect doesn't bring me great joy, but currently is more desirable than going on.  The returning option is unattractive for two reasons: i) it is defeatist and ii) it is very steep and I am not looking forward to going down a slope that was so difficult to come up.

I must remember in future not to set my sights too high with regard to tramping.  There are many magnificent walks to do without pushing myself to the limits.  Here comes Peter now - no water.  So back down the way we came.

__08 December__  
09:00 - Bivvied last night by a creek at about 3000'.  Only flattish spot in the flood-water course so we risked it.  No rain.  This morning much like yesterday morning, with the same promise of a fine day.  Peter has gone on another recce.  We keep getting bluffed out.  Not so bad without a pack (as Peter is now while I wait on a ledge).  Unfortunately it is still misty thus making route finding rather awkward.  This won't lift until ten-ish.

Last night we didn't finish eating until after 21:30, and the sleep was not exactly comfortable.  However, despite the restless sleep I feel better now, but still more daunted than usual.

Coming up passed the waterfall near the bottom yesterday was fascinating.  Solid rock with natural flow-forms sculpted into them.  Also one very nice spa-sized bath.  Very refreshing to dunk one's head into!

Trying to make the base of that waterfall was difficult.  We tried to bash through 3m scrub first.  Hands and knees territory.  This proved to be unsuccessful, but ... we did stumble (literally) on a group of native orchids.  Beautiful modest green.  We retreated and found an easier way.

Bluffed out - back to yesterday's spot.  But this time carrying water!!

10:30 - Now back on top of ridge that we had reached last night before returning.  Took an hour from the creek.  Mist has lifted and the sun is shining brightly.

Coming up we ventured upon a bluff with a scree slope below.  We skirted along underneath this bluff (south west aspect) following a row of mountain buttercups (_Ranunculus insignus_) looking for all the world like someone had planted them there.  Presumably they were following the moisture seeping out of the bluff.

Also in the same spot were tiny flowering _Euphrasia_ (eye bright).  These pretty little flowers - white with a yellow throat and dark filaments looking insect-like - are a root parasite.  Feathery tutu (_Coriaria_) are also fairly common and presently in flower.

Weather possibly packing in - better go.

__09 December__  
10:55 - We have stopped along the track to photograph some orchids.  Back to yesterday ... We were unable to make it further up the ridge without undue anxiety.  The rock is still unstable from the earthquakes.  Even huge boulders (500 lbs?) could give way under had or foot.  With the steepness of the country in many places a slip would be fatal.  We didn't come for that sort of thrill!  So it was back down, passed the waterfall and flow-forms, down Kendall Creek, and Taraua Tramping Club walk to Thor Hut.  That day our backpacking began a little after eight in the morning and finished a little before eight in the evening.

Whilst sitting atop the ridge we debated our options.  One was to try further up Kendall Creek to get up on top of Kendall Ridge/Herbert Range.  We felt this would preclude a chance of spending much time in the Roaring Lion wilderness area.  Hence we returned and are now headed for the Karamea Bend.

A few other plants I should mention include _Pratia_ (a small white flower which looks a little like it is missing one petal), _Epilobium_ or willow herb which carry tiny white flowers on the end of long ovaries, _Cardamin_ which have Nasturtium-like leaves and develop long seed pods like _Epilobium_.  These pods develop after fertilisation and are not apparent in the flower.  Today we have seen a lovely wee orchid (coloured like commercial varieties but much smaller).  It had an interesting hook mechanism to facilitate insect pollination.

Karamea now a big river with deep and frequent pools of clear water.  We often see huge trout in these pools - four in one pool!

Finished lunch - time to go (13:45).

19:00 - Leslie Hut at Karamea Bend.  Arrived here - flash hut - and quickly went down for a swim and wash.  Lovely and warm with good fresh wind to keep away sandflies and help dry clothes!  Good to feel clean again.

Had some lower back pain and mild sciatica last night and feel it again now.  Must hang upside down a bit.

NZFS have planted a Eucalyptus woodlot here.  A good idea?  Many apparently fine ideas have lead to ecological disasters.  What if they seed everywhere?  Why not use manuka or some other native as a woodlot species?

Must mention the _Phylocladus_ (celery pine).  As a tiny seedling these have true podocarp-type leaves or needles.  But as the seedling grows the characteristic celery 'leaf'(really a flattened petiole) develops.  Peter and I saw tiny seedlings with the two 'leaf' styles today.  Only about 50mm high.  Also saw a lovely native broom in flower.  Tiny purple and white flowers.

__10 December__  
14:14 (after lunch) - Resting under a flowering kamahi looking over the Karamea towards some limestone bluffs.  Peter noticed a trout in the pool here so we baited a hook with a centipede and threw it in the pool.  No luck so far which hardly surprises us.  We'll perhaps try again at the Roaring Lion.

Weather so far has been brilliant, but today there is quite a wind which may auger a change.

Have seen lots of animal sign along the Karamea, and actually saw four goats.  Bush is very open - these facts are probably related.

Shortly after leaving Karamea Bend hut we came across some _Equisetum_ and have seen it off and on ever since.  Some stands are very dense and quite pure,  However, getting it out would be a problem.

Crossing the Leslie this morning was not 'lovely and warm' - strange how things change overnight!

Must wind in the line.

__11 December__  
08:04 - Just packing to leave Roaring Lion Hut.  No time for comment; just wanted to note down _Hydrophilis letratorous_ and it to mentioned in this hut regarding testing with a rubber glove not to be touched^[This is as written in the diary, but it doesn't make sense and I could find no reference to _Hydrophilis letratorous_ on the internet].

11:47 (on ridge leading up to Marshall Range) - Another change of plans this morning brings us up here.  We are headed for the Peel Range in the end but may alter plans again.  Roaring Lion Hut has a nice aspect - unfortunately many people chopper in and out.  This sort of thing always leads to an untidy hut.  Sandflies were very bad, but the hut was screened and smelt so much of fly-spray.  Made a lure out of chocolate wrapper but did not catch any trout.  Only tried for a short while however.

RL Hut is in the wilderness area and so is this country northwards.  However, deer and goat sign is so prevalent that this is more modified than many places I have been.  Including Kendall.  Also the number of introduced weed species along the Karamea is disappointing.

Walking to RL Hut was most varied.  Around bluffs, through swamps, bush and tree graveyards, sand like a desert and shingle banks.

__12 December__  
08:25 (Marshall Range above Cavern Creek) - Just packed up the bivvy and about to go.  Uncomfortable last night - also sleeping bag got wet from the dew.  Almost dry now though.

Big day yesterday - left RL Hut about 08:45 and finally arrived at bivvy site 20:15.  Bit of snow up here for water.  Didn't get dark until around 21:30, although with the bright quarter moon (waxing) it didn't really get dark until it set, blood-red, around 03:00.  Sunset over Grange Range was magnificent.

Saw a hare up here.  Also heard a stag and saw a hind in the bush on the way up.  Keas up here, busy all night necessitating a spot of defensive action to prevent bivvy damage.  Also seen a couple of black-backed gulls wheeling around this morning, and yesterday evening.

Quote for yesterday - from Peter - "You can see those squid boats a long way away.  Mind you, they can't be that far or else you couldn't see them."

On our way - almost.  The numerous lakes and tarns in this country are really impressive.  Hundreds of tempting camp sites.  Unfortunately we are getting a little pushed for time and food (reminds me - one loaf of Norths Bread and 250g cheese will do for five lunches at 4$\frac{1}{2}$ slices per lunch.  Second loaf gone moldy now).  Actually lack of time detracts a little from the pleasure.  Towards the end of the afternoon with miles left to go, I get a little despondent.  Peter, however, seems the model of patience and fortitude.

Going now ...

10:45 (upper Cavern Creek) - Things to do at home: make putties, wash sleeping bag and shorts, test fertiliser sacks as bivvy bag, mend boots, polish leather jacket.  As much as anything, I note these down as a remark on my thinking.  My boots, or rather the right one, is falling to pieces.  The nails securing the uppers to the sole are pushing through and jabbing into my foot.  This is less painful than one might expect.  Anyhow, I have removed three, which in addition to those gone earlier, make the sole only loosely attached.  Not much longer to hold out now however.

Just found a low herbaceous Coprosma-type with a little orange berry I associate with the genus.  Peter squeezed the berry to reveal two seeds which he said confirmed it as a Coprosma, although he was surprised it was so soft and herbaceous.  But ... I have just been interrupted.  Peter has discovered the plant to be a _Nertera_!!  The two seed test apparently only works to distinguish between shrubby types of plant.

There has been a particularly prolifically flowering hebe on the tops.  Right in the peak of flowering.  Give it a kick and it sheds petals like snow.

__13 December__  
Early morning (saddle between Mt Prospect and Mt Ranolf at head of Chaffey Creek) - Bivvied here last night.  Set up camp in the mist - rather Peter did while I went off to get water.

Coming down Cavern Creek was slow work.  Not especially difficult (although had it been in flood it would have been impossible!) but slow.  Right at the end it was rather gorged with big boulders interspersed with pools.  Necessitated a brass monkey wade which caused us to fill the gorge with yells!

Made it to the Roaring Lion by about 15:00 and thus began a long slog up through the bush.  Nearer to the top however the way became quite distinct - following a clear ridge, possum line, vegetation survey and hunters' main route into the Roaring Lion from the Cobb.

We made the tops by around 19:30 and reached this site at 20:30.  Never seem to get time to read!

Throughout the trip the bellbirds have been delightful.  More like the chiming of bells than I have heard before.

Another splendid day.  07:50 now - clear up camp, get some more water and go ...

Midday (more or less) - Peter photographing a plant.  We have just come over Ranolf - our first named peak.  The view was incredible.  This side some of the climbing was a little tricky too.  Good fun though.

From Ranolf one can clearly see our trip for yesterday and the day before.  Yesterday, coming down Cavern Creek, two incidents occurred to me.  Once the branch I was standing on gave way and I fell down a hole.  I recovered with my face about 10mm from a bunch of nettle!  Another time, I left to cross the river and gently pushed off from the boulder nearby.  Suddenly I spun a full 360$^\circ$ on one foot placed on a slippery stone.  Again, I regained balance.  Guardian angels busy!

I'm resting in a wee saddle among the vegetable sheep (_Raoulia_).  Very much 'out of this world' these vegetable sheep grouped around on the stones.  As I only have two slides left, words will have to do.

Before leaving the camp this morning I shot down to get more water.  However, there are many tarns and patches of snow about so it was hardly necessary. In fact, we are forcing ourselves to drink more than we want so that our bottles and bellies can be full as we leave each supply.  Who knows where the next supply will be.

Maybe I mentioned it earlier, but going up Kendall Creek (it seems so long ago), I lead us through a rugged slip site and Peter lost his hat.  Now he wares a flour sack that I brought up as a spare billy bag.  With his map/knife belt, boots and putties, dark glasses, zinc cream and flour sack he really looks the part.  Desert king!  Not that I can look like much with a knotted red 'kerchief as a sady-style head cover!

Still haven't decided whether to exit via Tablelands (out tomorrow afternoon) or Cobb (out this afternoon).  Both ourselves and our clothes now very much in need of a wash, despite the bath at Karamea Bend.  Hope our chauffeur can tolerate the smell!

19:30 (Cobb Reservoir, settlement end) - We decided to drop down (steeply) into the Chaffey and walk to Trilobite Hut.  It was our intention to camp there, and walk out along the road tomorrow.  However, we arrived just in time for a lift with a vegetation surveyor to the settlement.  Now we await our ride home.

Walking out today we saw some flowering gentian (did I mention the odd-leaved orchid we saw on the tops?), _Bulbinella_ (Maori onion), bluebells and a small greenish clematis with a glossy green invaginated leaf.

All in all a splendid tramp. __No__ regrets!!.  Perfection ...

## St james Walkway (December 1989)
### Harm tho Seeth, Alisa, Michael and me

__Day 1__:  
The bus was late so we weeded the bark garden around the war memorial.  Alisa felt a bit travel sick on the bus although she didn't complain.  There was a small 4-year-old girl on the bus, and Alisa enjoyed talking and laughing with her.

We finally started our walk around 14:10 (forgot to mention we passed a number of cyclists whilst on the bus, including Ule and Kristin).  The children walked well, although Alisa complained a little of sore shoulders. In fact, she and Michael are getting the Arnica out now!   Some trees had fallen over in the path recently - probably in the storm we had last Friday.  We saw some friendly robins, also rifleman.  Heard long-tailed cuckoo, and possibly shining cuckoo as well.  Also discovered a clump of hooded orchids with their unique pollination mechanism.

Made the hut (Cannibal Gorge) after 4 hours (track time 3$\frac{1}{2}$).  First here, but now (20:00) there are about 3 other parties - 7 or 8 people in all.

__Day 2__:  
Christopher Hut:  Arrived about 15:30 after leaving Cannibal Gorge just before 08:00.  On Harm's suggestion we went down to the Ada River (snow fed) for a bath.  We all felt like we could walk another 100 miles after that!

Dinner is cooking, Alisa is playing the recorder and Harm is entertaining Michael while I write this.

Has been quite a long day today, but the children have managed well.  Some highlights: a bridge called Billy Goat Gruff Bridge, range horses, Michael and Alisa washed their socks and shoes in every creek, Harm taught them to count to ten (zehn) in German, some beautiful rest spots in the sun with magnificent views of the mountains.  Harm carried Michael's pack for about 20 minutes during the day, and I did the same for Alisa.  Somebody had picked some wild gooseberries and left them in the hut so maybe we will have a pudding tonight.

One beautiful day, although there are signs that tomorrow's weather will not be so salubrious.  It snowed here a couple of days before we arrived!

__Day 3__:  
Camping by the Anne River about 2$\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers up from the confluence with the Henry.  Left at 08:00 this morning though I had to go back for Michael's hat.  Arrived here about 16:45.  Lovely spot.

Forgot to mention that Michael and I went to fix the water supply at the last hut and on the way back Michael got stung by a nettle.  "Daddy, that plant bit me!".  Poor chap.

Today has been long and hot and a little tedious.  Seventeen km in all.  Highlights: Michael slipped down a bank almost into the Anne, getting to know William Earl of Kent as we leap-frogged passed each other, sliding down a hill at the camp-site (knicker-bocker breaking or bottom-bruising), finding small trout in the Anne.

Early night tonight (20:00) which __may__ lead to an early start tomorrow.

__Day 4__:  
Wonderful night's sleep.  Good early start - about 08:00.  Intermittent drizzle today with a chilly tail wind.  Highlights: Anne Saddle, dead hare on the path, Michael and Alisa colliding on the path, all of us in Harm's tent at night, Alisa getting to like swing bridges, pole bridge, three huts (Rokeby, Boyle River and Magdeline), mistletoe, wassailing Harm, nice evening meal of kidney beans with pea & ham soup mix added, good pace kept by the children who both carried their packs all the way.  Bed at 20:20.

__Day 5__:  
Out to the road by about 11:00.  Boiled billy and had some soup.  Allan almost passed us - in fact, he did but just noticed us in time and returned.


## Mt Arthur carpark to Rolling River Junction (December/January 1991/92)
