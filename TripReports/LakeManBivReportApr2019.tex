\section{Background}

On 3 September 2017, we visited Lake Man Biv to assess what needed to be done by way of maintenance and renovation.  On 4 April 2019 we flew in to undertake the work as identified at that time (and confirmed with a more recent visit in January 2019).  This report documents what was achieved before we flew out late afternoon on 9 April.

\section{Maintenance and renovation}

\subsection{Required work}

\subsubsection{Done}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Replaced the lead-head nails with hex-screws.  The ridge cap still has lead edging but this has been well painted, and is (hopefully) unlikely to attract the attention of kea
 \item Filled a few small nail holes in the cladding
 \item Painted the exterior:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Preparation: It rained (and snowed) on 5-7 April, and the temperature never reached 10$^{\circ}$C.  On these three days the exterior was prepared for painting.  On the roof, most existing paint was removed (Figure \ref{LMB4})
  \item On the morning of 8 April the Biv was fully primed (Figure \ref{LMB6})
  \item The first top coat was applied in the afternoon, and the second the following day (Figure \ref{LMB7})
 \end{itemize}
 \item Dug a trench on the upper (i.e., south) side of the Biv (Figure \ref{LMB4}).  This will need regular clearing
 \item Removed some accumulated rubbish
 \item A pick-axe was left for digging toilet holes
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Not done}
\begin{itemize}
 \item A weather ledge on the exterior of the door was not fitted
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Desirable}

\subsubsection{Done}

\begin{itemize}
 \item As the weather precluded the option of removing the roof, the ceiling was insulated from inside and lined with ply under the rafters (Figures \ref{LMB9} and \ref{LMB10}).  This had the advantage of allowing more insulation (about 100mm \textit{cf} about 40mm).  However, it has slightly decreased the internal height of the Biv
 \item Installed internal trim around the doorway to reduce unwanted draft
 \item Fitted an internal door bolt
 \item The bench was replaced with a stainless-steel topped one located under the window (Figure \ref{LMB8}). The existing bench was freed from the floor and left so that it could be used outside when the weather permits (we found this useful)
 \item Rebuilt the shelves (Figure \ref{LMB9}).  These are now much sturdier
 \item Supplied mattresses (Figure \ref{LMB10}).  The canvas was removed and replaced with slats to accommodate the mattresses.  A third mattress was not left as we consider there to be insufficient space
 \item Installed a small double-glazed window in the apex on the west wall\footnote{Mistakenly referred to as the south wall in the September 2017 report.} (Figures \ref{LMB5} and \ref{LMB6})
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Extras}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Installed a tilting seat (Figures \ref{LMB9} seat down, and \ref{LMB6} seat up)
 \item Laid plastic sheet under the hut, and used excess insulation under parts of the Biv (whether this proves to be a boon to cold feet, or a haven for rodents remains to be seen)
 \item Replaced signs with current DoC signage
 \item Replaced hut book, and built a holder for same
 \item Cleaned walls and scrubbed the floor
\end{itemize}

Notes:

 \item For the window, the quotes ranged from \$406.23 to over \$1000
 \item The total cost of the materials was estimated to "less than \$1000", \textit{cf} the actual cost of \$1247.02.  The two chopper trips were expected to be "approximately \$3000", \textit{cf} the actual price of \$.
